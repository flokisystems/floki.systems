---Foundation---

All the projects today rely on a donation-based system in order to further develop the product, as most of them present their project as an investment. This means that most of them rely on developers/marketing/any other name wallets to accomplish their roadmap. 

The main issue with this is that in order to get any value from those wallets they have to sell those tokens onto their community and therefore affecting token’s price. Some of them are intentionally hiding Rug Pulls behind those kinds of operations. $FLOKI$ is here to solve this issue.

---Solution---

Each $FLOKI$ transaction will include a fee of 4% that will be converted into BNB and sent to the development wallet. By performing this operation $FLOKI$ will be able to perform marketing and develop products without any penalty to its holders. This way, Floki’s token, $FLOKI$, will only grow in value, a real value. 

Beside this, $FLOKI$ has two other advantages compared to other tokens. With each transaction $FLOKI$ will impose an additional 5% fee which will be redistributed between the holders based on their share of tokens. Thus, you will gain tokens only by holding them, no staking will be needed, the contract will take care of that. Considering a dead wallet has been created, it will act as a holder and the token will become deflationary. Note, that no one has access to the dead wallet.

---Real Use-case---

Floki’s tokenomics will allow all of our ideas to be implemented. We believe that $FLOKI$ will evolve together according to the view of the community. We will start the project with an online merch and gift area, from which anyone will be able to get a toy, treat or custom clothes for is/her trusted companion. You will be able to get those products only with $FLOKI$. All the $FLOKI$ that is raised in the merch and gift shop will be used for the development of the project. In the near future we plan to launch our own NFT Marketplace where you will be able to create, buy and sell dog related NFTs by using your $FLOKI$. And this is not all, once all the stages in the roadmap will be completed, the second chapter in the $FLOKI$ story will begin.
